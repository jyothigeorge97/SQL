-- BASIC QUERIES
-- 1. Total number of unique diagnoses*
SELECT count(distinct ICD9_CODE) as number_of_unique_diagnoses FROM diagnoses_icd;

-- 2. Total number of unique procedures
SELECT count(distinct ICD9_CODE) as number_of_unique_procedures FROM procedures_icd;

-- 3. Total number of unique drugs
SELECT count(distinct DRUG) as number_of_unique_drugs FROM prescriptions;

-- 4. Number of unique diagnoses for each patient
SELECT SUBJECT_ID, count(distinct ICD9_CODE) as number_of_unique_diagnoses FROM diagnoses_icd GROUP BY SUBJECT_ID;

-- 5. Number of unique procedures for each patient
SELECT SUBJECT_ID, count(distinct ICD9_CODE) as number_of_unique_procedures FROM procedures_icd GROUP BY SUBJECT_ID;

-- 6. Number of unique drugs for each patient
SELECT SUBJECT_ID, count(distinct DRUG) as number_of_unique_drugs FROM prescriptions GROUP BY SUBJECT_ID;

-- 7. Number of patients for each diagnosis
SELECT distinct ICD9_CODE, count(SUBJECT_ID) as number_of_patients FROM diagnoses_icd GROUP BY ICD9_CODE;

-- 8. Number of patients for each procedure
SELECT distinct ICD9_CODE, count(SUBJECT_ID) as number_of_patients FROM procedures_icd GROUP BY ICD9_CODE;

-- 9. Number of patients for each drug type
SELECT distinct DRUG_TYPE, count(SUBJECT_ID) as number_of_patients FROM prescriptions GROUP BY DRUG_TYPE;

-- 10. Number of admissions for each patient.
SELECT SUBJECT_ID, count(HADM_ID) as number_of_admissions FROM admissions GROUP BY SUBJECT_ID;


-- ADVANCED QUERIES
-- 1. For each number x, report the number of patients who have been admitted x times
SELECT x, count(SUBJECT_ID) AS Admitted_Patients_x_Times FROM 
(SELECT SUBJECT_ID, count(distinct HADM_ID) AS x FROM admissions GROUP  BY SUBJECT_ID) AS number_of_patients_who_have_been_admitted
GROUP BY x;

-- 2. Create views for the following tables: diagnoses_icd / prescriptions /procedures_icd, such that only patients with 5 or more admissions are preserved
-- View for diagnoses_icd
CREATE VIEW D AS SELECT * FROM diagnoses_icd 
WHERE SUBJECT_ID IN (SELECT SUBJECT_ID FROM admissions
GROUP BY SUBJECT_ID HAVING count(distinct HADM_ID) > 4);
-- View for prescriptions
CREATE VIEW Rx AS SELECT * FROM prescriptions 
WHERE SUBJECT_ID IN (SELECT SUBJECT_ID FROM admissions
GROUP BY SUBJECT_ID HAVING count(distinct HADM_ID) > 4);
-- View for procdures_icd
CREATE VIEW P AS SELECT * FROM procedures_icd 
WHERE SUBJECT_ID IN (SELECT SUBJECT_ID FROM admissions
GROUP BY SUBJECT_ID HAVING count(distinct HADM_ID) > 4);



-- CASE STUDY: Most common diagnoses
-- 1. Create a temporary table T for diagnoses_icd, such that only the first three characters of the diagnosis code are preserved. Subsequently,
CREATE temporary table T
SELECT ROW_ID, SUBJECT_ID, HADM_ID, SEQ_NUM, left(ICD9_CODE, 3) as NEW_ICD9_CODE FROM diagnoses_icd;
--       A.count the number of unique diagnoses in T
SELECT count(distinct NEW_ICD9_CODE) AS number_of_unique_diagnoses FROM T;
--       B.count the number of unique diagnoses for each patient in T
SELECT SUBJECT_ID, count(distinct NEW_ICD9_CODE) AS number_of_unique_diagnoses_for_each_patient FROM T GROUP BY SUBJECT_ID;

-- 2. Repeat 1 entirely, except the first three digits in every diagnosis should be preserved (in addition to any letters) and saved in a temporary table T1.  E.g., for code ‘V3001’ preserve ‘V300’; for ‘0389’ preserve ‘038’.
CREATE temporary table T1
SELECT ROW_ID, SUBJECT_ID, HADM_ID, SEQ_NUM, CASE CONVERT(ICD9_CODE, CHAR) 
WHEN left(ICD9_CODE, 1) like '%[a-zA-Z]%' then left(ICD9_CODE, 4)
ELSE left(ICD9_CODE, 3) END AS PRESERVED_ICD9_CODE FROM diagnoses_icd;
--       A.count the number of unique diagnoses in T1
SELECT count(distinct PRESERVED_ICD9_CODE) AS number_of_unique_diagnoses FROM T1;
--       B.count the number of unique diagnoses for each patient in T1
SELECT SUBJECT_ID, count(distinct PRESERVED_ICD9_CODE) AS number_of_unique_diagnoses_for_each_patient FROM T1 GROUP BY SUBJECT_ID;

-- 3. Use T1 created in 2. Count patients diagnosed for each ICD-9 code* and list the top 10 most common diagnoses.
SELECT PRESERVED_ICD9_CODE, count(distinct SUBJECT_ID) AS Patients FROM T1 GROUP BY PRESERVED_ICD9_CODE 
ORDER BY Patients DESC LIMIT 10;
